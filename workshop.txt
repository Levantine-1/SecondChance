title=[B42] Second Chance: Survive Zombie Bites with Prompt First Aid
description=Second Chance: Survive Zombie Bites with Prompt First Aid aims to make medical occupations and first aid more useful, and gives players a chance to survive zombie bite infections through saving throws, influenced by their traits, skills, occupations, and actions.
description=
description=When bites are 100% guaranteed death, most players opt for bleach which is very anticlimatic and players would rarely get to experience the effects of the infection.
description=This mod adds depth to the infection system, making it more engaging and rewarding for players who prepare and act quickly while also adding the tension of wondering if you will survive.
description=
description=This mod uses Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) style dice rolls to determine if players will live or die.
description=
description=NOTE: If you succeed the DC check, you will enter what is called "Fake Infection". You will feel the effects of the infection but will not actually die, so don't drink bleach as soon as you feel queasy, you don't know if you're still alive.
description=
description=NOTE 2: You MUST disinfect the bite wound with bottle of disinfectant, alcohol swaps and alcohol soaked cotton balls. Poutices don't work.
description=
description=Note 3: Infections from scratches and lacerations are not changed.
description=
description=How It Works
description=Infection Detection:
description=
description=- This mod detects when the player becomes infected through a bite.
description=- Infection start time and vector (e.g., bite) are recorded.
description=
description=Saving Throw Mechanics:
description=
description=- Every ingame minute (2.5s IRL at default day length), the mod checks if the player has treated their wounds.
description=
description=- If wounds are treated, the player rolls a saving throw to determine survival.
description=
description=- The saving throw is influenced by:
description=- Occupation: Doctors (+5) and nurses(+3) have higher bonuses. The following are +1 to saving throws {"policeofficer", "fireofficer", "parkranger", "veteran", "securityguard"}
description=
description=- Traits: Traits like Resilient and Lucky improve the roll, adding 1 for each trait up to a max of +3. The following traits improve rolls: {"FirstAid", "FastHealer", "Resilient", "ThickSkinned", "Dextrous", "Strong", "Athletic", "Outdoorsman", "Lucky"}
description=
description=- First Aid Skill: Higher skill levels provide additional bonuses starting at first aid level 6 giving +1 for each level up to a max of +5
description=
description=- Total max bonus saving throws at time of writing this document is +13
description=
description=
description=Dynamic Difficulty:
description=
description=- The base DC (Difficulty Class) is 16, with no bonus occupation, trait or skill level bonus saving throws, is a 20% chance of survival, and ~70% chance with all bonuses, at 0 ingame minutes elapsed.
description=
description=- The DC increases by 1 for every 3 ingame minutes of untreated infection.
description=
description=- After 1 ingame hour, the DC becomes impossible to beat.
description=
description=Critical Rolls: (Off by default)
description=
description=In D&D fashion with critical rolls:
description=- Rolling a natural 20 restores endurance and fatigue as a bonus.
description=- Rolling a natural 1 player becomes drunk, stressed and unhappy
description=
description=Advantage Rolls: (Off by default)
description=
description=In D&D fashion with advantaged rolls:
description=- Rolls the die twice, picks highest number. I was planning on tying this in with the lucky trait, but now that it's gone, this is just going to be a sandbox option for now until i figure out what to do with it.
description=
description=Infection Resolution:
description=
description=- If the player succeeds the saving throw, the infection is cured, and all infection-related data is reset.
description=- If the player fails, they are marked for death.
